      <h1>JsonRpc</h1>
<p>
This is a complete implementation of the JSON-RPC 1.1 protocol, as
described in the JSON-RPC 1.1 Specification of 7 August 2007, which may be
found at <a
href="http://json-rpc.org/wd/JSON-RPC-1-1-WD-20060807.html">json-rpc.org/wd/JSON-RPC-1-1-WD-20060807.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The implementation consists of two parts: a service side and a client side.
The server part is written specifically for Ruby on Rails, but the client
does not really require Rails. A Rails application may choose to act as a
service provider, as a client, or both.
</p>
<h2>Server Side</h2>
<p>
A Rails app may host any number of services. A service is declared in a
controller, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
 class ExampleServiceController &lt; ApplicationController

   json_rpc_service :name     =&gt; 'DemoService',                                   # required
                    :id       =&gt; 'urn:uuid:fdba4820-276b-11dc-ab85-0002a5d5c51b', # required
                    :version  =&gt; '0.1',                                           # optional
                    :summary  =&gt; 'A simple demonstration service.',               # optional
                    :help     =&gt; 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/services/index.html',     # optional
                    :address  =&gt; 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/services',                # optional
                    :disabled =&gt; false,                                           # optional
                    :logger   =&gt; RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER                             # optional

   json_rpc_procedure :name       =&gt; 'sum', :proc =&gt; :+,                          # required
                      :summary    =&gt; 'Sums two numbers.',                         # optional
                      :help       =&gt; 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/services/sum.html',   # optional
                      :idempotent =&gt; true,                                        # optional
                      :params     =&gt; [{:name =&gt; 'a', :type =&gt; 'num'},             # optional
                                      {:name =&gt; 'b', :type =&gt; 'num'}],            # optional
                      :return     =&gt; {:type =&gt; 'num'}                             # optional

   json_rpc_procedure :name =&gt; 'time', :proc =&gt; lambda { Time.now.to_s }

 end
</pre>
<p>
For the exact meaning of the args, read the JSON-RPC 1.1 specification -
it&#8216;s very straightforward. The only additions are the
<tt>:disabled</tt> and the <tt>:logger</tt> options. <tt>:disabled</tt>, if
true, will make the service not accept any incoming calls at all. You can
enable and disable a service dynamically too, using
<tt>ExampleServiceController.enable</tt> and
<tt>ExampleServiceController.disable</tt>, respectively. <tt>:logger</tt>,
if true, will make the JSON-RPC client side log all JSON-RPC calls, their
parameters and the returned values using the logger, which should respond
to the <tt>debug</tt> message.
</p>
<p>
Create a controller for each service you need. Then declare routes for them
in Rails&#8217; config/routes.rb file:
</p>
<pre>
 ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|

   map.connect 'services/*method', :controller =&gt; 'example_service', :action =&gt; 'receive_json_rpc_request'

 end
</pre>
<p>
<tt>services</tt> is the external name of the service (it can be anything,
of course). The complete URI to your service will be something like <a
href="http://www.yoursite.com/services">www.yoursite.com/services</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the <tt>:action</tt> arg must have the exact value
indicated above, and the route string must end with &#8217;/*method&#8217;.
In future versions there might be a helper to create JSON-RPC routes, but
as yet that piece of syntactic sugar is not available.
</p>
<h2>Client Side</h2>
<p>
The client side of things is the module <a
href="../classes/JsonRpcClient.html">JsonRpcClient</a>. To connect to a
service as defined above (locally on your computer or anywhere in the
world), define a class to encapsulate your remote calls:
</p>
<pre>
 class Yonder &lt; JsonRpcClient
   json_rpc_service 'http://www.yoursite.com/services'
 end
</pre>
<p>
You can now call procedures remotely on your new class as the receiving
object:
</p>
<pre>
 Yonder.time
 Yonder.sum 24, 6
 Yonder.sum :a =&gt; 24, :b =&gt; 6
 Yonder.sum :b =&gt; 6, :a =&gt; 24
 Yonder.sum :b =&gt; 6, '0' =&gt; 24
 Yonder.sum '0' =&gt; 24, '1' =&gt; 6
</pre>
<p>
<b>Note</b> that all the calls to <tt>sum</tt> are equivalent. For further
information, see the JSON-RPC 1.1 specifications. The use of named
arguments is encouraged.
</p>
<p>
<b>NB</b>: If at all possible, use an IP number in the URI instead of a
host name, as the Net::HTTP library can be slow in resolving addresses,
which may render your requests two magnitudes slower.
</p>
<p>
Also note that your JSON-RPC client class, &quot;Yonder&quot; in this
example, never is instantiated.
</p>
<h2>Client side retries</h2>
<p>
When a retriable failure occurs (e.g. the service is down server-side), by
default a total of three tries are attempted. You can modify this by
passing a parameter to <tt>json_rpc_service</tt>, <tt>:retries</tt>. This
may be an integer specifying the number of retries to perform after the
initial one (thus this figure is always one less than the total number of
tries made.)
</p>
<p>
However, <tt>:retries</tt> may also be a hash with the following possible
components:
</p>
<pre>
  :max_retries  - The total number of retries or nil (= infinite). Default: 2.
  :max_time     - The total number of seconds allowed for retries starting from
                  the beginning of the whole operation. Default: nil (no limit).
  :sleep        - The number of seconds to wait between retries.
                  Default: nil (don't wait).
  :sleep_factor - A factor with which to multiply the sleep time after each
                  sleep period. Default: 1.5.
  :sleep_max    - Ceiling value for the modified sleep time.
                  Default: nil (no upper limit).
</pre>
<p>
Thus, if you specify nil or leave out <tt>:retries</tt> altogether, the
JSON-RPC client will do three tries without waiting in between, after which
the operation will fail with the original exception.
</p>
<p>
You can also change the retry parameters locally - per service - by using
the class method <tt>retry_strategy</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
  Yonder.retry_strategy(:sleep =&gt; 5.0, :sleep_factor =&gt; 2.0, :sleep_max =&gt; 5.minutes) do
    Yonder.sum 24, 6
  end
</pre>
<h2>Asynchronous queueing of client-side requests</h2>
<p>
It is possible to execute code asynchronously in other processes. This is
not limited to JSON-RPC calls. Any code involving <a
href="../classes/ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> classes and instances
can be enqueued for execution using the simple method <tt>enqueue</tt>. It
is possible to specify jobs consisting of any number of discrete steps. For
each job step, it is possible to specify rollback operations to execute in
case the job step fails, with configurable retry counts and much more. It
is also possible to specify failure handlers for jobs which fail entirely.
</p>
<p>
The basic syntax is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  enqueue({job-step-1}, {job-step-2}, ... {job-step-n},
          :job-config-param-1,
          :job-config-param-2,
          ...
          :job-config-param-n)
</pre>
<p>
The method <tt>enqueue</tt> always returns true. This means that you cannot
retrieve the result of the job by normal means. If it&#8216;s needed (which
rarely is the case), you must use a job step to do so.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8216;s a simple example of an <tt>enqueue</tt> call:
</p>
<pre>
  enqueue :target =&gt; @user, :do =&gt; :do_something, :do_args =&gt; [x, [1, 2, 3], User.find(xxx)]
</pre>
<p>
This will set up a call to <tt>user.do_something(x, [1,2,3],
&lt;some_user&gt;)</tt> in another process.
</p>
<p>
Each job step may have a single <a
href="../classes/ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> object as its target,
but it is also possible to invoke class methods:
</p>
<pre>
  enqueue :target =&gt; MyClass, :do =&gt; :some_class_method
</pre>
<p>
And of course, if there is more than one job step:
</p>
<pre>
  enqueue({ :target =&gt; myobj, :do =&gt; :a_myobj_method, :do_args =&gt; ['foo'] },
          { :target =&gt; other, :do =&gt; :foo },
          { :target =&gt; myobj, :do =&gt; :something_final })
</pre>
<p>
Please note that all args and targets are retrieved fresh from the database
for each job step. Thus the two references to <tt>myobj</tt> in the above
code are not the same object in memory, but two distinct instances (which
of course still may be identical).
</p>
<p>
Each job step can take the following key/value pairs:
</p>
<pre>
  :target        - An ActiveRecord class or instance
  :do            - A symbol naming the method to invoke on the target
  :do_args       - An array of arguments to pass to the invoked method. ActiveRecord instances
                   and classes may appear in this array, but only on the top level.
  :rollback      - A symbol naming a method to invoke on the target in case the :do operation
                   fails (i.e. an exception is raised).
  :rollback_args - An array of arguments to pass to the invoked rollback method. The same
                   rules as for :do_args apply to :rollback_args.
  :tries         - An integer which specifies the total number of tries to be performed for this job step.
                   Defaults to 3 (but if there is a :tries value defined for the whole job,
                   then that value is used instead - more on this further down).
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Job.html">Job</a> configuration parameters can be
specified as the last hash in the <tt>enqueue</tt> call (which thus may
either be a job step or a hash of job configuration parameters - and
remember that any &quot;loose&quot; symbol/value pairs in any Ruby method
call will be grouped together as a hash).
</p>
<p>
The job configuration parameters can be any or all of the following:
</p>
<pre>
  :target       - An ActiveRecord class or instance (only used with :on_failure)
  :on_failure   - A symbol naming the method to invoke on the target if the operation fails.
                  Any exceptions generated by the :on_failure call are suppressed silently.
  :failure_args - An array of arguments to pass to the :on_failure handler. The same
                  restrictions apply to this argument list as to the :do_args and
                  :rollback_args argument lists.
  :tries        - An integer which specifies the default total number of tries to be performed
                  for each job step (and which can be overridden individually in each
                  job step). Defaults to nil.
  :unordered    - If true, the job is permitted to execute in parallel with any other job.
                  If false (the default), the job is ordered, meaning it will execute
                  in strict order compared to all other ordered jobs. Only one ordered
                  job will be permitted to execute at one time. This means you can depend
                  on the results of one ordered job for any following job.
  :synchronous  - Normally false. If true, it overrides the value of :unordered and will
                  cause all calls to enqueue to be performed synchronously. This is
                  the default value in the test and build environments.
</pre>
<h3>Service Description</h3>
<p>
When the client is created, it will connect to its service and download its
Service Description. This makes the JSON-RPC 1.1 client interface
self-configuring. You can obtain the Service Description object by calling
</p>
<pre>
  Yonder.system_describe
</pre>
<p>
which will return a hash. The JSON-RPC specification requires that this
method be called &#8216;system.describe&#8217;, but as this is not possible
in Ruby the period has been replaced by an underline character. This is
only on the Ruby client side; the server, which is completely standard
compliant, will of course respond as required to
&#8216;system.describe&#8217;.
</p>
<h3>Parameter coercion</h3>
<p>
Limited conversion between parameter types will be performed: the JSON-RPC
interface will convert between numeric and string types as necessary,
provided there is no ambiguity and no loss of precision. Parameter types
are checked by the services and errors returned if there is a type mismatch
- except for strings and numbers as described above.
</p>
<h3>GET and POST</h3>
<p>
The plugin will make GET requests for procedures which are known to be
idempotent (roughly: which return the same result for the same parameters
always, and which do not mutate any data). Procedures are declared
idempotent on the service side. For all other procedures the plugin will
choose do to a POST. They are equivalent in speed, but GET posts have the
added advantage of being cacheable by proxies, etc.
</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>
The JSON-RPC 1.1 protocol is very lightweight. The JSON-RPC server side,
under Rails, is able to process about 4000 requests per second on my 2.16
GHz Intel Core Duo iMac. The client side is comparable in speed, but the
determining factor in this case is the Net:HTTP library, which can be
unnecessarily slow. It is important to use an IP number instead of a host
name, for instance. On my system, the client side can generate between 500
and 1000 requests per second. Note that these figures apply to the
production environment, not the development environment, which of course is
slower.
</p>
<p>
In future, a different HTTP library than Net::HTTP may be used on the
client side.
